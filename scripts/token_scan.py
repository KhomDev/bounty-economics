"""The identity-token vocabulary, and the one matcher that scans for it.

Both live here so that the checks CI runs and the checks the test suite runs are
literally the same functions. `scripts/check_hygiene.py` scans the whole
repository; `scripts/check_generic.py` scans the shipped taxonomies. Both import
from this module, and so does `tests/test_token_scan.py`.

Boundaries
----------
A token counts only when it stands alone as a word. The matcher is the explicit
form of a word boundary:

    (?<![A-Za-z0-9_]) TOKEN (?![A-Za-z0-9_])

That is the fix for a real defect. The previous matcher compared the character
either side of a hit against a set that treated `-`, `_` and `.` as separators,
so a word that merely CONTAINED a token was reported as the token. Widening the
separator set was the wrong repair and exempting the words was worse: the correct
boundary is a word boundary.

A token that does not end in a word character gets no trailing boundary, because
none can exist there.
