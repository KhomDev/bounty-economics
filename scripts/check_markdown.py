"""Check that every Markdown file renders, and that any README pin names a real version.

A shell rewrite mangled backticks across all three sibling repositories: fence
lines became "`@" in two of them, and here a code span in CONTRIBUTING.md picked
up two stray backticks. Two of them also told readers to pin a tag that did not
exist. This is the same check the siblings run. It catches line-level fence damage;
a stray backtick inside a sentence is not caught, because it looks like valid
inline code.

What it checks:

  - No line in a tracked .md file starts with "`@".
  - Every tracked .md file has an even number of ``` fence lines.
  - Every "bounty-economics/tree/vX.Y.Z" link in README.md names the version
    in pyproject.toml.

Run: python scripts/check_markdown.py
Exit code 0 = clean, 1 = a problem, 2 = could not run.
